# Intercom Interview Assessment
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.2.

## Second Interview Question
What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on
professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what
impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.

My proudest achievement in recent memory is the deployment of Quickservices, a web application I developed in response to the inability of customers to transact due to COVID-19 restrictions. The app allows customers carry out transactions they would ordinarily need to perform in the banking hall from the comfort of their homes. I was particularly proud of the fact the project was deployed bug free within a month of initiation, as it eliminated the risk versus reward dilemma of coming into the banking hall for customers. There was also a significant impact for the bank as $3 million in revenue was accrued through the channel within 3 months of deployment. I gained particular insight into distributed systems on the project while also becaming the go to person for test driven development to ensure bug free deployment in my team
